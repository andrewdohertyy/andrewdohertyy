### Hi there 👋

I'm Andrew Doherty, a junior developer based in Manchester. I'm a proactive technology professional having just completed a full-stack development course. I have several years of leadership and mentoring experience.

I am an ambitious individual with a strong work ethic and a desire to improve myself. I have a huge passion for tech, learning and development, and helping teams succeed.

I enjoy continuous learning and engaging with stakeholders at every level.

Some of the languages and frameworks i have worked with are:

HTML,
